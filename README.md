# Air-Quality-Prediction-AI
Air Quality Prediction is a machine learning project that analyzes environmental data—such as temperature, humidity, particulate matter (PM2.5/PM10), and gas concentrations—to predict air quality levels. The model helps identify pollution trends and provides early warnings, supporting better decision-making for health and environmental safety.
